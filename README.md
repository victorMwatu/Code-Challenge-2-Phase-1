# Code Challenge 2 Phase 1 Event Guest List Manager

## Description

This is a student submission for the first Code Challenge assignment/ week 2 Code Challenge, canvas title: SA.02:Week2-Code challenge: Event Guest List Manager

In this code challenge, I created a simple **Event Guest List Manager** that uses JavaScript to manipulate the DOM.

I practiced working with forms, capturing user input, and updating the page dynamically using JavaScript — all without refreshing the browser.

## My Solution

I built a deliverable-driven solution where users can manage an event guest list through browser interactions. The application captures user input through forms and updates the display in real-time.

## Project Structure

This repository contains two files, 'index.html' and 'style.css' and a directory named 'src' containing 'index.js'. I structured my code as follows:

```
event-guest-list-manager/
├── index.html          # HTML layout and structure
├── src/
│   └── index.js        # JavaScript logic and DOM manipulation
└── style.css           # Styling and responsive design
```
## Features Implemented

✅ **Guest Registration Form** - Users can input guest details  
✅ **Dynamic Guest List Display** - Shows, edits, and deletes all registered guests without page refresh  
✅ **Real-time Updates** - List updates immediately when new guests are added, edited, or deleted
✅ **Form Validation** - Prevents empty submissions  
✅ **Responsive Design** - Works on both desktop and mobile devices  
✅ **Clean UI** - User-friendly interface with proper styling
